Hosts also agree to promptly notify Anystay of any updates to any contact information previously submitted. 1.6 Anystay may revise the Host ToS at any time by posting an updated version on this web page. You should periodically visit this page to view the most current Host ToS because they are binding on you. 1.7 Hosts who violate the Host ToS may have their access to and use of the site suspended, and their listings may be amended and/or removed from the site, at Anystay\u2019s discretion. This is in addition to any other legal rights and remedies available to Anystay under these Host ToS or otherwise. 2. This platform is a venue only 2.1 This Site serves as a marketplace that allows Hosts to list one or more properties for rent (\u201cProperties\u201d) with various pricing structures for potential guests (and all individuals named in the booking) (\u201cGuests\u201d). Together, Hosts and Guests are referred to as \u201cUsers\u201d. The site may also provide online booking requests, instant bookings, and other tools or services to facilitate communication and transactions between Users. 2.2 The Site merely provides a platform for Users to interact. Anystay is not a party to any contractual relationship between the Guest and the Host regarding any booking, Property, or payment, and does not mediate disputes between them. It is acknowledged and agreed that the Guest and the Host are responsible for fulfilling the obligations of any such agreements. Anystay is not a party to these agreements and disclaims all liability related to these agreements. This holds true even if the Site facilitates a Property booking or the use of other Services, as Anystay is not a party to any rental or other agreement between Guests and Hosts. 2.3 Hosts and Guests agree to comply with all laws, rules, and regulations applicable to their use of the Site, their use of any Services, and any transaction they enter into on the Site or in connection with their use of the Site. Hosts further agree to comply with all laws, rules, and regulations applicable to the listing of their Property and the operation of their business. This includes, but is not limited to, laws, rules, regulations, or other requirements related to taxes, credit cards, data security, data privacy, permits, planning or license requirements, local authority requirements, health and safety compliance, and compliance with all anti-discrimination and housing laws, lease or other property restrictions. Even though Anystay is not a party to any rental transaction and assumes no liability for legal or regulatory compliance related to any Property listed on the Site, there may be situations where we are obligated or required to provide information related to any Listing to comply with governmental or regulatory bodies in relation to investigations, litigation, or administrative proceedings. We may choose to comply with or disregard such obligations at our discretion. 3. Terms of property listings 3.1 Hosts, in accordance with the Host ToS, can list a specific property on the Site via a pay-per-booking listing (\u201cListing\u201d). 3.2 Upon signing up as a Host on the Site, you will receive our Host newsletter, which is an essential part of the services we offer. We may occasionally offer different newsletters to enhance the services we provide. Hosts can opt-out at the time of signing up or unsubscribe from these email newsletters at any time through Settings, though it may take some time for preference changes to take effect. 3.3 Host Eligibility for Listings 3.3.1 To create a Listing, Hosts must adhere to the practices outlined in this clause 3 and any other requirements that Anystay may notify the Host about from time to time. 3.3.2 Hosts must manage all communications, inquiries, and bookings through Anystay\u2019s platform and tools. The use of external tools and bookings not processed through Anystay\u2019s platform are strictly prohibited. 3.3.3 Payments to Anystay must be made via direct debit. All banking and other payment-related fees are the responsibility of the Host. 3.3.4 Hosts who qualify as Property Managers may apply to Anystay to enter into a separate Property Manager Listing Contract. 3.3.5 Anystay reserves the right to refuse any Listing without reason, including any Listing that could infringe or be associated with the infringement of any provision of these Host ToS. 3.3.6 Hosts must provide only accurate and current information in each Listing and must not impose different conditions on the Guest than those outlined in the Listing. Failure to comply with these Host ToS may result in the Host\u2019s permanent exclusion from the Site and any of our affiliated sites. 3.4 Payment Terms for Listings 3.4.1 Each Listing is made without any upfront fee. However, in return, the Host will be charged and must pay Anystay a Service fee equal to a percentage of the total rental amount inclusive of any additional fees set by the Host on every booking made through the Site (\u201cService fee\u201d). Anystay reserves the right to change the method for calculating the Service fee, with any changes notified to the Host at least 30 days before the new Service fee calculation method is applied. The new Service fee calculation method will be considered accepted if the Host does not remove their Listing by the time the new Service fee calculation method is applied. 3.4.2 The Service fee will be calculated excluding any amounts charged for taxes and any other product or service purchased by the Guest and charged by Anystay, such as insurance products. It is the Hosts\u2019 responsibility to accurately breakdown the different amounts charged to the Guests. 3.4.3 A breakdown of the applicable fees for your account will be displayed when you list your property on the Site. 3.4.4 All Listings are subject to additional terms, conditions, and requirements as set out during the registration for such Listing (including those of third-party providers). 3.4.5 In addition to online bookings, online payments are required for all Listings. Online payments are handled by third-party payment providers subject to the terms and conditions and privacy policies of such providers. 3.4.6 Listings might be shown on other websites within the Anystay, and on websites of companies that have distribution agreements with Anystay, provided these websites support online payment. However, Anystay only guarantees publication on the Site where the Host initially registered its Listing, subject to Anystay\u2019s discretion to publish or not publish a Listing. 3.4.7 Listings will be shown on the Site indefinitely. However, Anystay reserves the right to remove or refuse to publish any Listing at any time at its sole discretion. The Host also has the option to suspend or remove their Listing at any time, either through their dashboard or by contacting customer service. 4. Using the platform 4.1 When a Host registers, they are provided with a user profile, known as the \u201cDashboard\u201d, where their contributed data is stored and all their listed Properties are detailed. 4.2 The Dashboard offers various features designed to help Hosts manage their Properties on the site. However, these features and the Dashboard itself are provided \u201cas is\u201d, and Anystay does not guarantee that they will be complete or free from errors. 4.3 The \u201cOnline booking\u201d feature allows Guests to book properties online. Guests can pay the Host through an online payments gateway provided by a third-party payment provider. The online payments service is governed by the terms and conditions of the third-party payment provider or the Accommodation Fee Collection Agreement. The Host acknowledges that, apart from Anystay Payments\u2019 obligations under the Accommodation Fee Collection Agreement, Anystay has no control over or responsibility for online payment services. 4.4 The Dashboard also gives the Host access to Guest\u2019s Reviews of the Host\u2019s Properties and any available Host Review for a Guest who has contacted the Host. 4.5 Both Guests and Hosts can post reviews on the Site. By posting a review, the reviewer grants Anystay a perpetual, worldwide, irrevocable, unrestricted, non-exclusive, royalty-free, and fully paid-up license to use, copy, license, sublicense, adapt, distribute, display, publicly perform, reproduce, transmit, modify, edit, and exploit the review in connection with the Property and the business of Anystay or its affiliates. Guests can also post their own reviews of Hosts\u2019 Properties (\u201cGuest Reviews\u201d) on the site. The Host can view Guest Reviews and respond to them (\u201cHost Response\u201d). Hosts can also review the Guests\u2019 stay (\u201cHost Review(s)\u201d). The Host guarantees that any posted review complies with Anystay\u2019s Content Guidelines. More details about the Host review process can be found here. Anystay reserves the right to make Host Reviews available to other Hosts whom the Guest contacts via the Site. The Host may not disclose or use Host Reviews further without the Guest\u2019s express consent. Anystay does not verify the accuracy of Guest Reviews or Host Reviews and is not responsible for doing so. Host Reviews cannot be used to exclude or discriminate against individuals. The Host acknowledges that its only remedy in relation to Guest Reviews, and Anystay\u2019s only obligation, is to allow the Host to post a Host Response. Anystay expressly disclaims any liability for any Guest or Host Review. 4.6 Anystay requires all Guest Reviews, Host Responses, Host Reviews, and other communications to comply with the Content Guidelines and may refuse to post any that do not. If any Guest Review, Host Response, Host Review, or other communication appears on the Site but does not comply with the Content Guidelines, Anystay reserves the right to immediately remove the non-compliant content from the Site. 4.7 Communications on the Site and other Services can be reviewed by the Guest and the Host involved in the communication, as well as by Anystay employees and representatives. Please be aware that, in line with our security and account requirements, we may remove or redact information from these communications (such as email addresses, phone numbers, or other content we consider inappropriate or non-compliant with applicable laws and regulations). Hosts are advised to print a copy of any important message, like a payment receipt or booking confirmation, for their records. 4.8 Messages sent through Anystay\u2019s systems should pertain only to legitimate booking inquiries. We do not accept spam or any form of unsolicited commercial electronic communications. Misusing Anystay\u2019s systems, such as by sending unsolicited commercial communications (spam) or disclosing Users\u2019 personal information to a third party without the User\u2019s express permission, is prohibited. Emails and Site recommendations sent via the \u201crecommend this site\u201d function should only be sent with the recipient\u2019s consent. You agree to protect other Users\u2019 personal information in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and at the very least, with a reasonable standard of care. You assume all liability for the misuse, loss, or unauthorized transfer of such information. 4.9 Anystay is not responsible for or involved in the communications between the Host and Guest. 4.10 Anystay imposes a service fee on Guests who book a Property on the Site through the Site checkout and Hosts who list their Property, subject to the service fee mode selected by Hosts. This service fee, which covers the use of the Site and features like 24/7 support, is calculated as a percentage of the total rental amount (which may include additional fees, taxes, and damage deposits charged by the Host). Depending on the laws of the jurisdiction where the Guest and/or Host resides, the service fee may be subject to (or may include) GST, accommodation taxes, or any other equivalent indirect taxes. Hosts are not allowed to encourage or advise a Guest to evade or bypass the service fee charged by Anystay. 5. Third party services 5.4 Anystay has integrated the Google Translate service into the Site. Hosts can use this service at no cost to translate their Listings. The Host acknowledges and agrees that this is a static machine translation system that may contain errors. After the translation, the Host must review and correct any inaccuracies. Anystay is not responsible for the operation, accuracy, or any other aspect of the Google Translate service. The Host agrees that Google Translate is provided under Google\u2019s terms and conditions of service, which the Host should review before using Google Translate. 5.5 Anystay requires all Hosts to confirm the location of their Listing in their Dashboard. This involves using information from Google Maps to accurately place the Listing location on a map and in regional searches. The Host agrees that Google Maps is provided under Google\u2019s terms and conditions and that Anystay is not responsible for the operation, accuracy, or any other aspect of Google Maps. The Host acknowledges and agrees that Google Maps\u2019 service is not error-free and the Host will ensure that the correct location of the Property is displayed by Google Maps when using this service. 5.6 Anystay also uses Google Analytics (and other analytics platforms) to collect statistics on Site usage. More details can be found in the Privacy Policy and in Google\u2019s own privacy policy. Google may aggregate data they collect from various services, including Google Analytics, Google Translate, Google Maps, and other Google services including YouTube. The Host accepts that the Anystay has no control over Google\u2019s data collection. 5.7 The Host can enable a free SMS service, which notifies the Host about incoming Guest inquiries and booking requests for Listings. The Host understands and agrees that SMS is not 100% reliable and may be subject to connectivity issues, disruptions, and blocking issues beyond Anystay\u2019s control. Additionally, the use of SMS messages, especially when traveling, may incur additional costs for Hosts from telecommunications and network providers, which the Host agrees to accept when signing up for the SMS service. The Host understands and agrees that SMS messages may be monitored and disclosed in accordance with the Privacy Policy. 6. Search ranking Anystay cannot assure that any Listing will appear in a specific order in the search results on a Site. The order of search results can vary based on numerous factors such as search parameters, Listing quality, the frequency of calendar updates, Guest preferences, Host response times, our Service fee level, adherence to our published requirements (including the Marketplace Standards), booking history, online booking capability, and other factors that Anystay may consider important to the user experience from time to time. Anystay reserves the right to employ various search algorithms or methods to optimize search results for specific Guest experiences and the overall marketplace. Listings may not always be included in search results. Listings distributed on third-party sites are not guaranteed to appear on such third-party site in any specific order or at all. Search results and their order may differ on Anystay\u2019s mobile application compared to its website. To enhance the search experience for both Hosts and Guests and to improve the search process, Anystay retains the right to conduct tests of limited duration that may modify how we display Listings and search results. 7. Property Managers Anystay may offer special terms to Hosts who have Listings for more than 15 Properties, referred to as \u201cProperty Managers\u201d. These terms can be requested by contacting Anystay. 9. Termination 9.1 Anystay reserves the right to take action if it determines or suspects that: a Host\u2019s listings or other content violate any applicable laws, regulations, or infringe upon the rights of any individual or entity; a Host has misused the Site or submitted inappropriate material; a Host\u2019s listing or rental practices are deemed unfair or unacceptable (for instance, if a Host double-books a property for multiple Guests on the same date, fails to accept bookings when the property is available, cancels previously accepted bookings, or engages in any behavior considered improper within the short-term property rental industry); a Host has repeatedly or significantly violated these Host ToS (including, but not limited to, breaches of clause 4 \u2018Using the Service\u2019, clause 12 \u2018Rights and obligations of the Host\u2019 or clause 14 \u2018Prohibitions\u2019) or any other obligations to Anystay, any Anystay Affiliate, or Guest; a Host has been offensive or abusive to any Guest or any employee or representative of Anystay; a Host has violated clause 14.1.4; a Host\u2019s conversion rate of Guest inquiries and booking requests to confirmed bookings is significantly lower than the average conversion rate on the Site over the past 6 months; a Host has used a false identity; Anystay\u2019s systems or communication platforms have been misused; or Anything similar to the above has occurred in relation to any of Anystay\u2019s Affiliates. In such cases, without limiting any of its other rights, Anystay may, at its sole discretion, (i) modify; (ii) suspend; or (iii) terminate either: (a) any affected Listings, or (b) all Listings associated with that Host (including any additional paid goods and services related to those Listings) immediately and without refunding Listing Fees or any other fees or charges paid by the Host. 9.2 In addition to the right to modify, suspend, or terminate any Listing, Anystay reserves the right to respond to any violation of the Terms or misuse of the Site by, among other things, restricting the Host\u2019s use of the Site, impacting the ranking of a Listing in search results, marking a Listing as \u201cinactive,\u201d and removing or altering information that may be false, misleading, or non-compliant with these Host ToS or any applicable law or regulation. 9.3 Anystay does not assume any obligation or responsibility to investigate complaints. 10. Rights and obligations of Anystay 10.1 Anystay reserves the right to alter, pause, or cease any part of the Site at any time, including the layout and the availability of any Services or content, without prior notice or liability. 10.2 Anystay will strive to accurately reproduce on the Site any photographs provided by the Host. However, Hosts recognize that variations from original photos can occur when scanning non-digital images and due to individual screen settings, and Anystay bears no responsibility or liability for such variations. 10.3 Anystay may periodically perform upgrades of the Site to keep up with technological advancements. As a result, maintenance work may occasionally be required, which could lead to limitations on the Site. Anystay will aim to conduct such maintenance when it least affects the majority of users. 10.4 Anystay may perform identity checks and request proof to verify the existence of a Property and/or a Host and the ownership of the Property. The Host acknowledges that Anystay has the right to conduct identity checks and due diligence on the Host or to require the Host to validate the existence of a Property. If asked, the Host agrees to promptly provide Anystay with such proof of identity or of a Property\u2019s existence as requested by Anystay. Each Host acknowledges that failure to comply with such a request constitutes a violation of these Host ToS. 10.5 Anystay adheres to its Privacy Policy. The Host gives Anystay permission to share the Host\u2019s contact details, including phone number, with Guests in relation to a Property booking. The Privacy Policy provides more details. Anystay may, if necessary (including to prevent fraudulent actions of a third party), disclose a Host\u2019s contact details to a Guest. The Host confirms that they have read the Privacy Policy and consents to the data processing as outlined in those policies. 10.6 Anystay retains the right to transfer these Host ToS, and to delegate or subcontract any or all of its rights and obligations under these Host ToS, to a third party or to any other entity within the Anystay, but will not do so in a way that diminishes any guarantees provided to the Host under these Host ToS. 10.7 We may occasionally offer or facilitate services to Hosts to enhance or improve the quality of their Property Listings. We may also create new or modify the location or geographic descriptions we use to identify properties in Listings and search results. As a result, we may alter the location or geographic description associated with any Listing. However, we do not take responsibility for verifying Listing content or the accuracy of the location. Hosts are solely responsible for ensuring the accuracy of Listing content and location or geographic descriptions and agree to quickly correct (or contact us to correct) any inaccuracies. 11. Intellectual property 11.1 Anystay Pty Ltd owns the Site. All content on the Site is safeguarded by copyright and other relevant intellectual property rights. Any reproduction of the Site, in whole or in part, including copying of text, graphics, or designs, is prohibited to the fullest extent allowed by law. 11.2 Hosts are allowed to download, display, or print individual pages of the Site to demonstrate their agreement with Anystay. The corresponding file or printout must prominently display the text \u201c\xa9 [Present Year] Anystay Pty Ltd - All Rights Reserved\u201d. 11.3 When a Host submits any type of content, including text or images, to the Site or through Anystay\u2019s platform or systems, the Host guarantees that they have the right to do so and have obtained all necessary consents or permissions from any owners of featured items (\u2018property release\u2019). 11.4 If a Host\u2019s reviews or other content contain trademarks or other proprietary names or marks, the Host guarantees that they have secured all necessary legal permissions and rights for Anystay to use such content on the Site. 11.5 By submitting content to the Site (and Dashboard) (including but not limited to all text, descriptions, reviews, photographs, etc.), Hosts give Anystay permission to use such content both on the Site and in separately published form. The Host grants each member of the Anystay a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, transferable, irrevocable, and fully sub-licensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, translate, distribute, publish, create derivative works from, and publicly display and perform any such submitted content globally in any media, now known or later developed, for any purpose. 11.6 If Hosts\u2019 Listings and other submissions contain trademarks, the Host assures that they have the right to use them, including the rights to sublicense. 12. Rights and obligations of Hosts 12.1 The Host is required to provide accurate, complete, and truthful information about their personal identity, payment details, Property offered in Listings, and other communications using Anystay\u2019s systems. 12.2 The Host continuously guarantees and asserts as long as any Property is listed on the Site or any stay regarding a booking for a Property is pending that: (i) they own and/or possess all necessary rights and authority to rent out and proceed with bookings for the Property listed by the Host; (ii) they will not unjustly retain a rental deposit in violation of the underlying rental agreement with the Guest; (iii) all of the information provided to Anystay is accurate and current, including all representations about any Property, its amenities, location, price, and its availability for a specific date or range of dates; (iv) each Listing pertains to an individual and uniquely identified Property; (v) they will not unjustly deny any Guest access to any Property; and (vi) they will provide all due refunds in accordance with the applicable cancellation policy or underlying rental agreement. 12.3 The Host commits to ensuring that the information on the Listing is kept accurate, complete, and current for the entire duration the Listing is on the Site, and: (i) if a translation is provided, to ensure that it is carefully and correctly translated, and: (ii) to adhere to the listing guidelines when creating the Listing. The Host shall not provide misleading details about the origin of any information or include details that may hide the true source of any information. 12.4 The Host must adhere to Anystay\u2019s Marketplace Standards found at Listing Policies as updated from time to time. These Standards outline certain requirements for Listings including but not limited to: The Host must keep an accurate reservation calendar on their Listing(s); The Host must make commercially reasonable efforts to respond to all booking requests from Guests within 24 hours of receiving such a request; The Host must also agree to make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure all Guest payments are processed within 24 hours of authorization by the Guest for such payment; The Host must respond to and accept a significant number of enquiries and booking requests received in the interest of the Guest experience; and The Host is prohibited from cancelling a significant number of accepted bookings. 12.5 The Host commits to ensuring that the calendar for each Listing is kept accurate and current to reflect the availability of the relevant Property as it is booked. On date-based searches, Listings with calendars that are out of date may be filtered out of results. 12.6 Hosts are responsible for ensuring that their Listings do not violate the law or the rights of any person or entity. Listings must not contain false information, personal insults, anything libellous, slanderous or defamatory, or anything that infringes copyright or data protection law. 12.7 Photographs included in a Listing should accurately represent the Property, must not be false or misleading, must not include people, and must not infringe the privacy rights, intellectual property rights or any other rights of a third party. 12.8 If any Listing violates these Host ToS, Anystay reserves the right to suspend, amend or terminate the relevant Listing or all Listings associated with the Host in accordance with clause 9 of these Host ToS. 12.9 Verifying user identities on the Internet is challenging, and we do not take responsibility for confirming each User\u2019s claimed identity. We advise Hosts and Guests to communicate directly with each other using the tools provided on the Site, although this does not guarantee the identity of the person you are communicating with. We also recommend taking other reasonable steps to confirm the other person\u2019s identity. You agree to: (i) keep your password and online ID for both your account with us and your email account secure and strictly confidential, sharing it only with authorized users of your accounts, (ii) instruct each person to whom you give your online ID and password not to disclose it to any unauthorized person, (iii) immediately notify us and choose a new online ID and password if you believe your password for either your account with us or your email account may have been compromised or known to an unauthorized person, and (iv) immediately notify us if anyone contacts you asking for your online ID and password. Moreover, if we suspect unauthorized access to your account, you agree to promptly change your ID and password and take any other related action as we may reasonably request upon our request. We advise against sharing your online ID and password for your account with us and your email account with anyone. However, if you do share your online ID and online password, or if you fail to adequately protect such information, you are responsible for all transactions that the person performs while using your account with us and/or your email account, even those transactions that are fraudulent or unintended. 12.10 a Host cannot transfer a Listing to another party. In case of a Property sale or change in Property management, Anystay will offer guidance on options for creating a new Listing. 12.11 If Anystay compensates a Guest for a loss caused by actions or omissions attributable to a Host through one of our guarantee or warranty programs at our sole discretion, Anystay reserves the right to seek reimbursement from the Host for the amount paid or contributed by Anystay toward the loss. 13. Taxes 13.1 As a property owner, it\u2019s your sole responsibility to identify and fulfill your tax obligations, such as reporting, collecting, remitting, or including in your Listing any applicable GST or equivalent indirect taxes, sales, occupancy and tourist taxes, gross receipts, real property or other visitor taxes or income taxes (\u201cTaxes\u201d), unless otherwise specified by the regulations of your country. Anystay doesn\u2019t offer tax advice, so it\u2019s recommended that you consult with a tax specialist. 13.2 We may be required by tax regulations to collect relevant Tax information from Hosts, withhold Taxes from payouts to Hosts, or both. If a Host doesn\u2019t provide us with sufficient documentation to alleviate our obligation (if any) to withhold Taxes from payouts, we will withhold such amounts as required by law, or do both, until such information is provided. You, as the Host, are solely responsible for ensuring that your tax forms are up-to-date, complete, and accurate. 13.3 The Host is responsible for all charges related to the Property and the Listings and must report all applicable Taxes on the payments they receive to the relevant authorities. Anystay may need to collect Taxes on the Service fees charged to the Host. If required, Anystay will provide the Host with an invoice stating the amount of Taxes charged on these Service fees. If the Host is eligible for an exemption from any Taxes on the Service fee, they must provide Anystay with the necessary documentation and support for this exemption. 13.4 If the Host resides in a country that is an EU member state and is VAT registered in that member state, they must provide Anystay with a valid VAT number for Anystay to apply the reverse charge mechanism to the Service fees. If the Host resides in Australia, the reverse charge mechanism doesn\u2019t apply and an Australian GST charge will be applied. 13.5 You should be aware that a relevant governmental agency, department, and/or authority (\u201cTax Authority\u201d) where your Listing is located may require certain taxes to be collected from Guests or Hosts related to such Listing and remitted to the respective Tax Authority. The laws may vary by jurisdiction, but these taxes may need to be collected and remitted as a percentage of the Rental Amount set by Hosts, a set amount per day, an amount based on the number of guests, or other variations. These taxes are sometimes referred to as \u201ctransient occupancy taxes,\u201d \u201chotel taxes,\u201d \u201clodging taxes,\u201d \u201ccity taxes,\u201d \u201croom taxes,\u201d or \u201ctourist taxes\u201d (\u201cStay Taxes\u201d). 13.6 In some jurisdictions, Anystay may choose to facilitate the collection and remittance of Stay Taxes from or on behalf of Guests or Hosts, in accordance with these Terms (\u201cCollection and Remittance\u201d) if such jurisdiction asserts that Anystay or Hosts have a Stay Tax collection and remittance obligation. In any jurisdiction where we decide to facilitate direct Collection and Remittance, you irrevocably instruct and authorize Anystay to collect Stay Taxes from Guests on the Host\u2019s behalf at the time the first online payment is made by the Guest, and remit these Stay Taxes to the Tax Authority. The amount of Stay Taxes, if any, collected and remitted by Anystay will be visible and separately stated to both Hosts and Guests on their respective transaction documents. Where Anystay is facilitating Collection and Remittance, Hosts are not allowed to collect any Stay Taxes being collected by Anystay related to their Listings in that jurisdiction. When Anystay facilitates Collection and Remittance of Stay Taxes in a jurisdiction for the first time, Anystay will notify existing Hosts with Listings in such jurisdictions. 13.7 You agree that any legal action related to Anystay\u2019s facilitation of Collection and Remittance of Stay Taxes will not involve any supplier or vendor used by Anystay in this process. Hosts agree that we may request additional amounts from you if the Stay Taxes collected and/or remitted are not enough to fulfill your obligations to the Tax Authority. Your only recourse for collected Stay Taxes is a refund from the Tax Authority, following their procedures. 13.8 You agree to protect, indemnify, and hold harmless the Anystay and their officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, debts, obligations, and expenses, including legal and accounting fees, related to Stay Taxes. This includes the applicability, calculation, collection, or remittance of Stay Taxes for your transactions. In jurisdictions where we facilitate Collection and Remittance, Hosts grant us permission to store, transfer, and disclose data and other information related to them or their transactions, Bookings, Listings, and Stay Taxes to the relevant Tax Authority. 13.9 Anystay reserves the right to stop the Collection and Remittance in any jurisdiction, with prior notice to Hosts. At this point, Hosts become solely responsible for the collection and/or remittance of any Taxes that may apply to Listings in that jurisdiction. In jurisdictions where we have not provided notice of, or are not facilitating the collection or remittance of Taxes, Hosts remain solely responsible for the collection and/or remittance of any Taxes that may apply to Listings. 13.10 Hosts acknowledge that in some jurisdictions, Anystay may choose not to facilitate the collection or remittance of Taxes or may be unable to do so. Nothing in these Terms of Service guarantees that Anystay will facilitate the collection and/or remittance of Tax in any specific jurisdiction or at all. Anystay reserves the right to stop any facilitation of collection and remittance of Tax for any reason, and will provide reasonable notice to Hosts in any jurisdiction where it decides to stop such facilitation. 14. Restricted use 14.1 The Host must not, either directly or indirectly: 14.1.1 Exploit, copy, distribute, reproduce, edit, translate, make publicly accessible, or decompile the Site, its content, or databases in any form, whether by using automatic devices or manual processes; 14.1.2 Monitor content on the Site or communications with Guests using robots, spiders, or other automatic instruments, except for general purpose internet search engines (excluding any website or search engine or other service that provides classified listings or property advertisements, or any subset of the same, or which is in the business of providing short term property rental services or other services that compete with the Site or Anystay) and non-commercial public archives that use tools to gather information for the sole purpose of displaying hyperlinks to the Site, provided they each do so from a stable IP address or range of IP addresses using an easily identifiable agent and comply with Anystay\u2019s robots.txt file; 14.1.3 Use the Site, Anystay\u2019s platform or systems, or any information provided by a Guest, for purposes other than those permitted by these Host ToS; 14.1.4 Use the Site or the Services to book or solicit a booking for a property other than a Property under a valid Listing; 14.1.5 Reproduce any part of the Site on another website or otherwise, using any device including, but not limited to, use of a frame or border environment around the Site, or any other framing technique to enclose any portion or aspect of the Site, or mirror or replicate any portion of the Site; 14.1.6 Upload or send to the Site (or Anystay\u2019s platform or systems) any content or programs that, due to their size or nature, might damage Anystay\u2019s computers or networks; 14.1.7 Include content on the Site or Anystay\u2019s platform or systems that violates any applicable criminal, intellectual property or other laws, or encourages any such violation; 14.1.8 Use or access the Site or Anystay\u2019s platform or systems in a way that might harm any computer system or network, including by making available any virus (for which purpose, \u201cvirus\u201d includes any program introduced into a system deliberately which carries out a useless and/or destructive function, such as displaying an irritating message or systematically over-writing the information on a User\u2019s hard disk); 14.1.9 Post or transmit information that is false, fraudulent, or misleading in any way, or engage in any act that may be considered \u201cphishing\u201d (whether primary, secondary or other) or that would result in criminal or civil liability; 14.1.10 Post or transmit any unlawful, threatening, abusive, libellous, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, indecent, inflammatory, sexually explicit, pornographic or profane material. 14.1.11 Do not make any references to any member of the Anystay or any of their respective affiliates in a way that could lead someone to believe that the Host, any Property, Listing or website is sponsored by, affiliated with, or endorsed by any member of the Anystay or any of their respective affiliates. 14.1.12 Do not replace a Property in a Listing with another Property without Anystay\u2019s prior approval.

Distribution of Listings to Third Party Websites. To help Hosts achieve wider distribution of their properties, we may distribute your Listing information and content, or otherwise facilitate the distribution of your Listing on a third party website. Additional terms and conditions may apply to such distributions, which we may notify you of via your Host Dashboard or email. 16. Responsibility of Hosts 16.1 We don\u2019t offer liability insurance protection for Hosts, property managers, or Guests, even if a User secures insurance coverage through third-party providers. Users are solely responsible for securing sufficient insurance coverage to safeguard their properties and guests or their trip, as applicable. Hosts agree to obtain and maintain adequate insurance coverage for the rental of the Properties they list on the Site from the arrival of their first Guest until the departure date of any Guest they have secured via our Sites. 16.2 The Host will bear sole responsibility for all financial consequences arising from any loss or damage to Anystay due to content or any program sent by the Host that causes any damage to Anystay\u2019s hardware or software, including damage to the Site, system, or data, or causing the Site or system to fail or experience faults. The aforementioned financial consequences include reasonable legal fees. 17. Indemnification The Host agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Anystay, any of their subsidiaries affiliates, their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents, from and against any claims, causes of action, demands, recoveries, losses, damages, fines, penalties, or other costs or expenses of any kind or nature including but not limited to reasonable legal and accounting fees, brought or occasioned by third parties alleging, arising out of, or in connection with (a) any content or material the Host submits or provides for inclusion on the Site; (b) any use by the Host of the Site; any breach of these Host ToS by the Host; and (d) the Guest\u2019s stay at the Property and use of associated services and facilities provided by the Host. 18. Contacting us 18.1 Any messages should be sent to Anystay using the contact form or Anystay\u2019s platform. 18.2 Notices regarding copyright infringements must include the following: Your address, telephone number, and email; Detailed information about the content in question (display of the image or text), including a link to the site; and A formal declaration indicating that you: (i) Hold the exclusive right to the work; and (ii) Have not authorised the use of the relevant material in this manner. 19. Dispute resolution 19.1 Anystay prioritizes customer satisfaction and will attempt to address any issues or disputes you may have. If we fail to resolve your concerns, you can proceed with claims as detailed in this section. 19.2 You agree to allow us the first chance to settle any disputes or claims related to the Site, these Host ToS, interactions with our customer service agents, any services or products provided, any statements made by us, or our Privacy Policy (\u201cClaims\u201d) by reaching out to us. If we cannot resolve your Claims within 60 days, you may seek redress through arbitration or in small claims court, as outlined below. 19.3 You accept and agree that all Claims will be settled by binding arbitration, not in court, except that: (a) you can present Claims individually in small claims court or tribunal if they qualify; and (b) either party can seek immediate equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party\u2019s intellectual property rights (including, but not limited to, copyright or trademarks), or in other urgent situations (such as any actual or threatened crime or cyber-attack). This includes any Claims you bring against us, our subsidiaries, travel suppliers, or any companies offering products or services through us (which are beneficiaries of this arbitration agreement). This also includes any Claims that arose before you accepted these Terms of Use, regardless of whether previous versions of the Terms of Use mandated arbitration. 19.4 There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is restricted. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including statutory damages, attorneys\u2019 fees, and costs), and must adhere to and enforce these Terms of Use as a court would. 19.5 The requirement to settle a Claim by binding arbitration will not apply if you provide us with written notice (including by email) that you reject the arbitration provisions of these Terms of Use within thirty (30) days following the date you first accept these provisions. If you don\u2019t provide us with such notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be considered to have fully waived (and without modification) your right to resolve any Claim or to seek any other relief by initiating proceedings in a court (except as set out in paragraphs 20(a) and (b) above). 19.6 Arbitrations will be conducted by the Australian Centre for International Commercial Arbitration (ACICA) under its rules, as adopted or amended from time to time. The seat of arbitration shall be Sydney (or, if you notify us in writing, your nearest state or territory capital city of Australia). The language of the arbitration shall be English. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the ACICA\u2019s rules. 19.7 You have the option to conduct an arbitration over the phone, through written submissions, or in person in your home state or any other location agreed upon by both parties. 19.8 To initiate an arbitration process, you need to send a letter that requests arbitration and outlines your Claims to \u201cAnystay Legal: Arbitration Claim Manager,\u201d located at Level 17, 1 Martin Place, Sydney NSW 2000 Australia. If we initiate arbitration against you, we will notify you at the email or postal address you\u2019ve provided. The rules and filing instructions of the ACICA can be found at https://acica.org.au/ or by calling +61 (0) 2 9223 1099. 19.9 All proceedings to resolve Claims will be carried out on an individual basis, not as a class, consolidated, or representative action. If a Claim is taken to court instead of arbitration for any reason, we both forfeit any right to a jury trial. The Commercial Arbitration Act 2010 (NSW) governs this agreement. Any court of competent jurisdiction may confirm an arbitration decision. 19.10 The laws of New South Wales, Australia, govern these Terms of Use. Any use of this Site that does not comply with all provisions of this Agreement, including this paragraph, is unauthorized. 20. General 20.1 If a court of competent jurisdiction deems any provision of the Host ToS invalid, the remaining provisions will stay in effect. The clause headings are for reference only and do not influence the interpretation or construction of these Host ToS. No waiver of any term of the Host ToS will be considered a further or ongoing waiver of that term or any other term. Anystay\u2019s failure to enforce any term of the Host ToS does not constitute a waiver of that term and does not affect Anystay\u2019s ability to enforce that term in the future. These Host ToS and the Privacy Policy make up the entire agreement between the Host and Anystay regarding the use of the Site. Changes to the Host ToS can only be made through a revised posting on this page."})]}),(0,y.jsx)(c.A,{})]})}}}]);
