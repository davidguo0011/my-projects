Services are provided via country specific URL’s, including, in Australia, www.anystay.com.au and via mobile\n                    applications (for mobile phone, tablet and other devices or interfaces) (collectively, the \"Site\"). Booking payments conducted through the Site (the “Payment Services”) are handled\n                    by third party payment providers, and/or Owners that are integrated property managers. Payment Services are subject to the terms and conditions of those Owners and third-party\n                    payment providers, outlined in Terms of Payment Services.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    1.2 These terms and conditions (the “Traveller T&Cs”) together with the Privacy Statement govern the relationship between Anystay.com and any individual using or accessing the Site\n                    and any of the content or services available through it as a traveller or potential traveller, and who is not using it in their capacity as a property owner or property manager\n                    (each, a “Traveller” or “you”). Travellers include people who use the Site to access information about and to book properties, whether for business or leisure purposes, from\n                    property owners or property managers.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    1.3 The Traveller T&Cs constitute a legally binding agreement between Anystay.com and the Traveller. By using or accessing the Site or our platforms or systems, you acknowledge\n                    that you agree to and are subject to the Traveller T&Cs and our Privacy Statement on behalf of yourself and all persons named or otherwise travelling on your booking. A Traveller’s\n                    booking through or use of Anystay.com is governed by the terms and conditions on this site through which the booking is finalised. If you do not accept and agree to the Traveller\n                    T&Cs without modification, you are not authorised to access or otherwise use the Site.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    1.4 Anystay.com does not authorise anyone to register with, or to otherwise use, this Site unless they have the capacity to enter into legally binding contracts.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    1.5 Anystay.com may revise these Traveller T&Cs at any time by posting an updated version to this web page. You should visit this page periodically to view the most current\n                    Traveller T&Cs because they are binding on you. Any changes made after you have made a booking will not affect that booking unless we are required to make the change by law.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    <strong>2.

We may also offer other tools or services to allow users\n                    to communicate with each other and to enter into rental agreements or other transactions with each other.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    2.2 The Site acts only as a platform for users to interact with each other. Anystay.com is not, and does not become, a party to any contractual relationship between the Traveller\n                    and the Owner in respect of any booking, Property or payment, and does not mediate between the Traveller and the Owner in the event of any dispute arising between them. You\n                    acknowledge and agree that the Traveller and the Owner will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such agreements, that Anystay.com is not a party to such agreements\n                    and that Anystay.com disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements. This is true even if the Site facilitates a booking for a Property or the use of other\n                    Services, as Anystay.com is not a party to any rental or other agreement between Travellers and Owners.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    2.3 Travellers are responsible for, and agree to abide by, all laws, rules and regulations applicable to their use of the Site, their use of any Services and any transaction they\n                    enter into either on the Site or in connection with their use of the Site. Travellers should please note that Owners are responsible for and agree to abide by all laws, rules and\n                    regulations applicable to the listing and rental of their Property and the conduct of their rental property business. Please be aware that even though we are not a party to any\n                    rental transaction and assume no liability for legal or regulatory compliance pertaining to any Property Listed on the Site, there may be circumstances where we are nevertheless\n                    obligated or required (as we may determine in our sole discretion) to provide information relating to any listing in order to comply with governmental or regulatory body\n                    investigations, litigation or administrative proceedings, and we may choose to comply with or disregard such obligation in our sole discretion.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    2.4 Anystay.com may charge a service fee payable by Travellers who book a Property on the Site via the Site checkout. The service fee covers the use of the Site, including such\n                    features as ongoing support, and is calculated as a percentage of the total rental amount (which may include additional fees and damage deposits charged by the Owner). Depending on\n                    the laws of the jurisdiction where the Traveller and/or Owner resides, the service fee may be subject to (or may include) GST, Stay Taxes (as detailed in section 2.7), or any other\n                    equivalent indirect taxes that are applicable. Owners agree not to encourage or advise a Traveller to avoid or circumvent the service fee charged by Anystay.com, and Traveller\n                    agrees not to avoid or circumvent the service fee.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    2.5 Anystay.com may be required to collect and remit taxes (inclusive of GST, sales taxes, or other equivalent taxes) on the Service Fee. Where required, Anystay.com will provide\n                    the Traveller with an invoice stating the amount of taxes charged on such Service Fee. If the Traveller is entitled to an exemption from indirect taxes or their equivalent on the\n                    Service Fee, it must provide Anystay.com with required documentation and support for such exemption\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    2.6 If the Traveller is a business traveller that is GST registered or an employee of a company that will reimburse GST charged, it must provide Anystay.com with the valid GST\n                    number and its related billing address, in order for Anystay.com to apply the reverse charge mechanism, where applicable, to the Service Fee. If the Traveller has a billing address\n                    in Australia, the reverse charge mechanism is not applicable and an Australian GST charge will apply.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    2.7 Collection and remittance of the Stay Tax: Travellers are liable for the payment of any tourist tax, lodging tax, tourism tax, or other similar taxes as requested by local\n                    jurisdiction (“Stay Tax”), which tax must be generally collected by the Owners. In certain jurisdictions, Anystay.com may decide in its sole discretion to directly collect and\n                    remit the Stay Tax on behalf of the Owners. In such case, the Owners will have no action to take regarding the collection from the Travellers and the remittance to the city of this\n                    tax. In any jurisdictions in which such process will be implemented, Owner instructs and authorizes Stays to collect the Stay Tax from the Travellers on their behalf and to proceed\n                    to the relevant tax filing requirements before the City, including its remittance.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    2.8 The Site contains Listings (defined below) provided by Owners and content from other third parties. Such content is the responsibility of the Owner or third party creator of\n                    the content. We have no responsibility for such content as we merely provide access to the content as a service to you and provide you with the facility to communicate directly\n                    with the Owner to enquire about a Property and make bookings with the Owner for the rental of such Property. All bookings you make are made directly with the Owner and your\n                    contract will be with the Owner. Any such contract will govern your right to occupy and use the Property, and may contain obligations to pay additional fees and taxes. Anystay.com\n                    has no liability to you for the Owner’s provision of the Property. We do not endorse, support, represent or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy or reliability of any information\n                    in the Listings or any opinions/content posted by third parties. 2.9 Anystay.com allows Travellers to display prices on the Site in the currency of their choice and may also allow\n                    Travellers to pay in the currency of their choice. Different currency choices are generally based on publicly available currency rates and are not guaranteed to be the best rate\n                    available. If your currency of choice is not supported for a booking, you'll be charged in the Owner's selected currency. In any event, the currency and exact amount you will pay\n                    will be displayed clearly at check out. Our overall compensation may be affected by the currency you choose to pay in. Note that if you pay in a currency different than the\n                    currency of your card, your bank or card provider may charge you foreign exchange, transaction, or other fees.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    <strong>3.

Thus, where a Listing is linked to an automated translation facility, such as Google Translate, it\n                    is the Owner’s responsibility to ensure that the resulting translation is accurate, and to correct any deficiencies.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    3.2 Travellers that use the Site to send enquiries, book a property or who register with us will receive our newsletter.

For online payment, a Traveller whose booking was confirmed can pay with their credit card or other\n                    supported payment methods through the payments gateway offered by our third party payment provider and/or the Owner. The online payment service is subject to the terms and\n                    conditions of the third party payment provider, or the Owner and Traveller agrees and acknowledges that (with exception of any obligation to instruct third party service providers)\n                    Anystay.com has no control over or any responsibility for this service.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    3.6 Enquiries sent by a Traveller to an Owner on the Site, may include Traveller’s personal information (including email address, phone numbers and other information the Traveller\n                    provides) and the Owner may use such personal information in order to respond to the Traveller.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    3.7 Any communication between Travellers and Owners using the Anystay.com platform must not include email addresses or phone numbers.

Please also be aware, in accordance with our\n                    security and account requirements, we may remove or redact information from any such communications (for example, email addresses, phone numbers or other content we deem to be\n                    inappropriate or non-compliant with the Traveller T&Cs or applicable laws and regulations).\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    3.8 Anystay.com may, from time to time, use third party email servers to send and track receipt of the Enquiry emails, and analyse the pattern of Enquiry usage reported by these\n                    third party tracking systems. Our system does not hold messages indefinitely and they may not be accessible after the message has been delivered to you. Please print a copy of any\n                    message which is important to you – for example a payment receipt or a booking confirmation.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    3.9 Anystay.com has no responsibility for or otherwise stated involvement in, the communications between the Owner and Traveller.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    <strong>4.

Anystay.com does not authorise\n                    anyone to register with the Site unless they are able to enter into legally binding contracts. As a result of successfully completing the registration process, the Traveller\n                    obtains a user account for the Site (an “Account”).\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    4.2 To obtain an Account, a Traveller must follow all of the instructions given by Anystay.com during the registration process.

We encourage Travellers\n                    and Owners to communicate directly with each other through the tools available on the Site. We further encourage Travellers to take other reasonable measures to assure yourself of\n                    an Owner's identity and of the Property and relevant details of your booking or proposed booking. You agree to: (i) keep your password and online ID for both your Account and your\n                    email account secure and strictly confidential, providing it only to authorised users of such accounts, (ii) instruct each person to whom you give your online ID and password that\n                    he or she is not to disclose it to any unauthorised person, (iii) notify us immediately and select a new online ID and password if you believe your password for your Account may\n                    have become known to an unauthorised person or has otherwise been compromised, and (iv) notify us immediately if you are contacted by anyone requesting your online ID and/or\n                    password. Further, if we suspect any unauthorised access to or use of your Account, upon our request you must promptly change your ID and password and take any other related\n                    action(s) as we may reasonably request. We discourage you from giving anyone access to your online ID and password for your Account. However, if you do give someone your Account ID\n                    and/or password, or if you fail to adequately safeguard such information, you are responsible for any and all transactions that the person performs while using your Account and/or\n                    your email account, even those transactions that are fraudulent or that you did not intend or want performed.

The order of appearance of those\n                    listings among all of the properties on the platform that meet the traveller’s search criteria (i.e., the sort order) then may be influenced further by traveller-selected sort\n                    preferences, such as low-to-high pricing or high-to-low ratings; as well as factors that are compared automatically by sort-algorithms, such as popularity of the property among\n                    other travellers, quality of the property and the listing content, competitiveness of rates and availability, and the amount we will earn in service fees, all relative to other\n                    properties that meet the traveller’s criteria. Traveller search-results and property sort-order are dynamic, and will vary from search to search, based on demand, availability,\n                    changes in partner status or listing popularity, and so on. In addition, as we continue to make improvements in our programs and tools, we may run tests or modify our default\n                    sort-order algorithms from time to time to help improve both the traveller and partner platform experience.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    5.8 When you make a booking for a Property sourced through the Site, Anystay.com in most instances will receive a commission for that booking.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    <strong>6.

We do not tolerate spam or unsolicited commercial electronic communications of any\n                    kind. It is prohibited to misuse Anystay.com’s systems, such as by sending unsolicited commercial communications (spam) or disclosing personal information of users to a third\n                    party, unless you have the express permission from the user. Emails and Site recommendations transmitted via the “Recommend this Site” function should only be sent with the\n                    recipient’s consent. You agree that you will protect other users’ personal information with the same degree of care with which you protect your own confidential information (using\n                    at minimum a reasonable standard of care), and you assume all liability for the misuse, loss, or unauthorised transfer of such information.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    7.3 Travellers may post their reviews of Owners’ Properties (“Traveller Reviews”) on the Site. The Owner is given the opportunity to view Traveller Reviews and to respond to them\n                    (an “Owner Response”). Owners will also be given the opportunity to rate the Traveller’s stay (“Owner Review(s)”) and such Owner Reviews will be made available to other Owners you\n                    contact. Owner Reviews cannot be used to exclude or discriminate against individuals. The Traveller’s sole remedy in relation to Owner Reviews, and Anystay.com’s sole obligation in\n                    relation to Owner Reviews, is to permit the Traveller to post a Traveller Review within 14 days of the submission of the Owner Review. Anystay.com otherwise expressly disclaims any\n                    liability for any Traveller Review or Owner Review. Traveller acknowledges and agrees that Anystay.com may make such Owner Review available to other Owners who the Traveller\n                    contacts through the Site. More detail as to the Owner Review process is available here.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    7.4 Please note that Anystay.com does not, and realistically does not have the resources to, verify the accuracy or otherwise of Traveller Reviews, Owner Responses or Owner\n                    Reviews.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    7.5 Anystay.com nevertheless requires all Traveller Reviews, Owner Responses, Owner Reviews and other communications using Anystay.com’s systems to conform to the Content\n                    Guidelines, and may decline to post any of them that Anystay.com finds do not comply.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    7.6 Anystay.com does not generally conduct identity checks. If Travellers suspect that an Owner has supplied false information, they are invited to notify Anystay.com through the\n                    contact form.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    7.7 Anystay.com complies with its Privacy Statement. Further details can be obtained from the Privacy Statement. The Traveller consents to the collection, use and handling of their\n                    data as outlined in the Privacy Policy. Travellers should note, Owners have generally authorised Anystay.com to forward the Owner’s contact details, including telephone number, to\n                    Travellers in connection with a Property booking. Travellers may ask for these details to be supplied on production of proof of the booking; alternatively, these details may be\n                    made available to Travellers through their Accounts.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    <strong>8.
