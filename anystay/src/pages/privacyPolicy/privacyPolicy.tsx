                    <br />
                    We will collect personal information from you only (i) where the personal information is necessary to perform a contract with you (e.g., manage your booking, process payments, or
                    create an account at your request), (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights (as explained below), or (iii) where we have your
                    consent to do so (e.g., sending you marketing communications where consent is required). In some cases, we will have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you
                    such as where it is necessary to use your transaction history to complete our financial and tax obligations under the law.
                    <br />

                    If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you
                    whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information). Certain countries
                    and regions allow us to process personal information on the basis of legitimate interests. If we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests
                    (or the legitimate interests of any third-party), this interest will typically be to operate or improve our platform and communicate with you as necessary to provide our services
                    to you, for security verification purposes when you contact us, to respond to your queries, undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of potentially detecting or preventing
                    illegal activities.

                    We may in some cases use automated decision-making, for example, in relation to assessing fraudulent transactions or suspicious activity on our site. As part of this processing,
                    automated decisions may be made by putting your personal information into a system and the decision is calculated using automatic processes. If you pose a fraud risk, this may
                    affect your ability to book on our site. You may have rights in relation to automated decision making, including the ability to request a manual decision-making process instead or
                    contest a decision based solely on automated processing. If you want to know more about your data protection rights, please see the Your Rights and Choices section below. Sharing

                    · Third-party service providers. We share personal information with third-parties in connection with the delivery of services to you and the operation of our business (for example,
                    to provide credit card processing, customer service, business analytics, and fraud prevention and compliance services, and to serve you with advertising tailored to your
                    interests). These third-party service providers are required to protect personal information we share with them and may not use any directly identifying personal information other
                    than to provide services we contracted them for. They are not allowed to use the personal information we share for purposes of their own direct marketing (unless you have
                    separately consented with the third-party under the terms provided by the third-party).

                    managers, and where available, activity providers, rail, or cruise lines who fulfill your booking. Please note that travel suppliers may contact you to obtain additional
                    information if and as required to facilitate your booking or to otherwise provide the travel or associated services.
                    <br />
                    · Business partners and offers. If we promote a program or offer a service or product in conjunction with a third-party business partner, we will share your information with that
                    partner to assist in marketing or to provide the associated product or service. In most of those cases, the program or offer will include the name of the third-party business
                    partner, either alone or with ours, or you will be redirected to the website of that business with notice. An example of such a business-partner relationship would be a third-party
                    loyalty program for which you could earn points by completing a booking on our platform.

                    <strong>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms.</strong>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to sites with which the browser communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this
                    feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether users are even aware of them. Participants in the leading Internet
                    standards-setting organization that is addressing this issue are in the process of determining what, if anything, sites should do when they receive such signals. We currently do
                    not take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess our sites’ responses to these signals and make appropriate
                    updates to this Cookie Statement.
